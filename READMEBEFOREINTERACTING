- Hi, Iâ€™m Star/Fundy
I use she/they pronouns, but I prefer they/them. 
DO NOT INTERACT IF YOU/ARE: Disrespect TTs/TDs, Racist, Homophobic, Jshlattie [support Jshlatt], ship DNF [DreamNotFound], supports Bi/Pan Lesbians [As ridulious as it sounds],
Areas I have out at: I usually hang at Docks, Spawn, Or DSMP area, I am usually free to talk to but sometimes I'm selectively mute and I prefer to just sit there, mainly when I'm in little space [Age Regressing] 
I have a TD [Touch Discomfort] So please do not come to close to me or touch me, or else I'll become super uncomfortable and go into a panic attack because of it. So please keep your distance from me, unless you're my friend.
I also tend to take things too seriously, so please use tone indicators around me so I don't get confused/take things the wrong way.
Anyways! I have you have a lovely day! Talk to you soon!
